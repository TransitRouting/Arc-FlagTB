# Arc-Flag Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (Arc-Flag TB)
This repository is based on the ULTRA framework. For more information, see [ULTRA on GitHub](https://github.com/kit-algo/ULTRA). To get actual GTFS data, see [gtfs.de](https://gtfs.de/) or [transit.land](https://www.transit.land/). In addition, it is worth stopping by [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

## Usage
To use the Arc-Flag TB algorithm, compile the executables in the  ``Runnables`` folder (using the ``Makefile``). Next to the ``ULTRA`` and ``Network`` executables are the ``ARCTB`` executable and two scripts called ``prepLayoutGraph.script`` and ``arcFlagTB.script``.

When executing ``ARCTB``, you can call ``runScript`` followed by the script name. For any command, you can call ``help`` followed by the command name to get information about the usage.

1. Prepare the GTFS Data by running ``prepLayoutGraph.script``. **Do not forget to change the directories to the GTFS Data in the script and the place where you want to store the computed binaries.** The script does the following automatically:

	* ``parseGTFS``simply parses the GTFS directory into a GTFS binary

	* ``gtfsToIntermediate`` uses the GTFS binary and computes an Intermediate binary (Note that the day-extraction also happens here).

	* Then some data reductions are used, e.g., only use the largest connected component or remove any degree two vertices.

	* ``intermediateToRAPTOR`` transforms the Intermediate binary into the RAPTOR binary

	* ``createLayoutGraph`` computes the layout graph for the given RAPTOR binary and stores it in the METIS file format (readable by [KaHIP](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP)).

2. Partition the layout graph. We recommend using [KaHIP](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP) since we used this tool in our experiments. Note that the partitioning step has to be performed outside of this repo. An example call for KaHIP could look like this: 
```
./KaHIP/deploy/kaffpaE Datasets/germany/raptor.layout.graph --k=128 --imbalance=5 --preconfiguration=ssocial --time_limit=600 --output_filename=Datasets/germany/raptor.partition128.txt
```

3. Compute the Flags. After partitioning the layout graph, you can compute the Flags by running the ``arcFlagTB.script`` script. **Again, make sure that the binary- and 'partitioned text files' - paths are correct**
	* As a first step, ``raptorToTripBased``computes the TripBased Data from the RAPTOR binary. Note that one can pass the text file with the partition values as a third parameter.

	* Finally, ``computeArcFlagTB``computes the Flags for the given Trip-Based data. Note that as a third parameter, one can pass the text file with the partition values (not necessary if you already passed it before during ``raptorToTripBased``). Here are optional arguments such as ``Fixing Departure Time``or ``Buffering``and the additional Flag Compression.

Additionally, query performance can be evaluated by using the following commands:

* ``runTransitiveTripBasedQueries`` runs Trip-Based queries. Note that some *transfer-edges* are deleted (during the Flag Computation) since unnecessary edges are unnecessary for correct queries. Hence by comparing the performance of Arc-Flag TB and the original TB, make sure not to pass the already 'smaller' Trip-Based binary to test the original algorithm.

* ``runTransitiveArcTripBasedQueries`` runs Arc-Flag TB queries. Note that an additional third parameter can be used to switch from/to the compressed Arc-Flag TB variant.

## Example

In the directory ``test`` is an example GTFS datasets (IC/ICE from [gtfs.de](https://gtfs.de/de/feeds/de_fv/)). You can run the executable ``ARCTB`` and, inside, call ``runScript prepLayoutGraph.script``. The last command executed by the script should produce the following output:

```
> createLayoutGraph ../test/raptor.binary ../test/exports/raptor.layout.graph true

```

After partitioning the layout graph (there is an example with k=32 inside the ``test/exports`` folder), you can run ``ARCTB`` again and call ``runScript arcFlagTB.script``. This yields the following:

```

```

**Note** Testing the (original) TB performance will result in faster TB queries than before computing Arc-Flags since we deleted unnecessary edges in the process. So if you want to compare the Arc-TB performance against the (orignal) TB, you should test the performance of the (original) **before** computing the Arc-Flags.
